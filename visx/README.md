# visx

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes

- Boilerplate:
  - `yarn remove @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event web-vitals`.
  - Delete `"react-app/jest"` from the `package.json` file.
- `??` ([nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator)):
  - It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is `null` or `undefined`, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.
