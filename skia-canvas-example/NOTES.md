  - "Skia Canvas is a Node.js implementation of the HTML Canvas drawing API for both on- and off-screen rendering. Since it uses Google's Skia graphics engine, its output is very similar to Chrome's `<canvas>` element â€” though it's also capable of things the browser's Canvas still can't achieve."
